# Lending Loft
Full stack library app to manage book borrowing service for a public library. App was developed independently from scratch including designing data structure. Main focus was developing React-redux and express app using typescript.
All features were not developed yet, work is on progress.
## Tech stacks:

### Frontend: Typescript, React, Redux, React-bootsrap, Formik-form, Yup validation, JWT

### Backend: Typescript, Express, mongoose

### Database: Mongodb

### Deploy: Backend to Heroku & Front End to Netlify

[Backend Repo](https://github.com/moscuet/library-server100)

## Live App [link](https://festive-albattani-cd3868.netlify.app/)
**Please be aware that the frontend app is currently not connected to the backend. This is due to recent changes in Heroku's free hosting policy, which led to the suspension of our server deployment.

# Library-App : Front-end

### Fast Track React app template with TypeScript & Redux 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
You should use either `npm` or `yarn` but not both. It's recommeded to use `yarn`

This template already comes with all needed packages. In case you want to install manually, check the dependencies in `package.json` file. To install, run:
```
yarn install
```

## Features
* Redux
* Redux-thunk
* Redux-saga
* React-router
* Prettier
* ESLint
* Husky & lint-staged

The template comes with ready-made code for a very simple working demo (products list). To play around with it, run:
```
yarn start
```

## Modify or add new features
Follow the file/folder structure as explained below to make necessary changes. For Redux, most of the time, you can copy existing files, modify something in there to make a new feature.

## Folder structure
* `src/components`: React components. For each component, it's better to put it in a separate folder. For example:
  ```
  src/components/Button/index.tsx
  src/components/Button/Button.scss
  src/components/Button/Button.stories.tsx
  src/components/Button/Button.test.tsx
  ```

* `src/hooks`: Custom hooks. For example:
  ```
  src/hooks/useCountries.ts
  src/hooks/useUser.ts
  ```

* `src/redux`: Everything (such as actions, reducers, sagas etc) related to Redux
  * `src/redux/actions`: For Redux actions
  * `src/redux/reducers`: For Redux reducers
  * `src/redux/sagas`: For Redux sagas
  * `src/redux/store.ts`: The Redux store

  If there are multiple un-related features, split action/reducer/saga into different files. For example:
  ```
  src/redux/actions/product.ts
  src/redux/actions/order.ts
  src/redux/actions/ui.ts
  ```
  ```
  src/redux/reducers/product.ts
  src/redux/reducers/order.ts
  src/redux/actions/ui.ts
  ```
  ```
  src/redux/sagas/product.ts
  src/redux/sagas/order.ts
  src/redux/sagas/ui.ts
  ```



* `src/pages`: Pages (or views) when using [React router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start). For example:
  ```
  src/pages/Home.tsx
  src/pages/Product.tsx
  ```
  If there are more files than just page's `*.tsx`, a folder structure can be used. For example:
  ```
  src/pages/Home/index.tsx
  src/pages/Home/Home.scss
  ```


* `src/types.ts`: TypeScript's type definitions. For small apps, you can put definitions of all types, interfaces etc and even Redux's actions, action creators, states here.

* `src/Routes.tsx`: Defines all the React router routes to different pages.

This template is suitable for rather small apps. For bigger apps, a better & more organized way is to split the folder structure into features, something like:
  ```
  sr/feature1
  --components
  --redux
  ----action.ts
  ----reducer.ts
  ----saga.ts

  src/feature2
  --components
  --redux
  ----action.ts
  ----reducer.ts
  ----saga.ts

  src/redux
  --action.ts
  --reducer.ts
  --saga.ts
  --store.ts
  ```
